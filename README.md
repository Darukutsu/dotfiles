I tried to make configuration universally accessible on any machine. Just be sure you've specified `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` somewhere (for example `/etc/security/pam_env.conf`)

Some configs will have readmes for clearance.

# TODO

- [ ] add links to original work
- [ ] add video/gifs/pngs of themes/workflow for certain configs
